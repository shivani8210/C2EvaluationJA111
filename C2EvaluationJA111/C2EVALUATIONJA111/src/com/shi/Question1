Q1) Explain the difference between IS-A and Has-A relationship with the help of an
example and explain about access modifiers and their accessibility?

Ans- IS-A relationship: Whenever one class inherits another class. 
	 
Example- If a class Bulb inherits another class Device, then we can say that Bulb is having IS-A relationship with Device, which implies Bulb is a Device. 

	 Has-A relationship: Whenever an instance of one class is used in another class.
	 
Example- 

class Car {
	private String color;
	private int maaxSpeed;
	public void carInfo() {
		System.out.println("Car Color= "+color + "Max Speed= " + maxSpeed);
	}
	public void setColor(String color) {
		this.color = color;
	}
	public void setMaxSpeed(int maxSpeed) {
		this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
	}
}
class Maruti extends Car {
	public void MarutiStartDemo() {
		Engine MarutiEngine = new Engine();
		MarutiEngine.start();
	}
}


	 Access Modifiers- It is used to set the accessibility of classes, interfaces, variables, methods, constructors, data members and the setter methods. It specifies the scope of field, method, constructor or class. We can change the access level of fields, constructors, methods and class by applying the access modifier on it.
	 
Example- 

class Animal {
	public void method1() {....}
	private void method2() {....}
}

	 There are four types of Java access modifiers-
	 1. Private
	 2. Public
	 3. Default
	 4. Protected
